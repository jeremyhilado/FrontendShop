## Project Description
Our group has decided to create an online shop that encompasses all aspects of the MERN stack. We spent some time and has discussions on what we all wanted to do and a clone of eBay/Amazon kept coming up. We decided to run with this idea and create our own version of the online mega stores. We wanted this project to be challenging, but we also wanted it to be obtainable. We beleive in our ablity to complete this project by the end date of Friday April 24th 2020.

##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
|Cart| shows items added to cart|
|Checkout| Allows items in cart to be sent to a checkout form|
|Description| Shows product description and other info|
|History| Shows a viewing history of the user|
|Home| Holds the search and all products|
|Products| API pulled from our seed file|
|Upload| allows user to upload a product|


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
